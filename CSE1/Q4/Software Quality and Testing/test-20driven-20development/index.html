  <h2 id="test-driven-development">Test Driven Development</h2><p>We first write tests before we implement the code. This doesn't mean you don't do test at the end, but you mix writing both tests in front and in the end.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Advantages</strong></p><ul><li>It makes you focus on the requirements, as it forces you to write small tests based on the requirements. This often has the result that you don't write useless code. </li><li>It helps with is controlling your pace, you can make larger steps if you are sure what you've done is good, smaller steps if you're not sure.</li><li>It helps you design the public interfaces of your classes</li><li>It makes you write testable code from the beginning (better observability, controllability, less mocks needed etc), giving you faster feedback and finding bugs faster</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Steps</strong></p><ul><li><em>Simplicity</em>: do the simplest implementation that solves the problem by the simplest possible test. Don't always do this, only when you feel you need to. </li><li>You start with very easy tests, make your implementation pass it, make new tests, make your implementation pass etc. This makes it easy to refactor, as you already have tests and you know what is the reason of failure if tests fail after refactoring (could be low-level, renaming variables etc or high-level, changing the class design).</li></ul>
