  <h1 id="ethics">Ethics</h1><p>Evaluation is any type of test/measure to see how well something performs. If your system interacts with people, your evaluation will nearly always also involve people! In that case, you need to take into account human-research ethics.</p><p><br></p><p>The Declaration of Helsinki - where a lot of human-research ethics are based on - defines the following:</p><ul><li>Respect for the individual, right to make informed decisions (both before and during research). People should know what they're getting into and give explicit consent.</li><li>Welfare of participants takes precedence over interests of science and society. The importance of an experiment never outweighs the health of the individual</li><li>Vulnerable groups call for special vigilance</li><li>Research should be based on a theoretical background</li><li>Risks should never outweigh benefits</li><li>Ethical approval should be gained from independent committee</li></ul><p><br></p><h2 id="tu-delft-hrec">TU Delft HREC</h2><p>The TU Delft Human Research Ethics Committee defines the following rules about minimal risk studies, i.e. the following studies are <strong>not minimal risk human research studies</strong>. </p><p><br></p><h3 id="vulnerable-participants">Vulnerable participants</h3><p>If the study involves particularly <strong>vulnerable participants</strong>, or participants that are unable to give consent, e.g.:</p><ul><li>Children</li><li>People with learning difficulties</li><li>Patients</li><li>People receiving counselling</li><li>People living in care or nursing homes</li><li>People recruited through self-help groups</li></ul><p><br></p><h3 id="subordinate-position">Subordinate position</h3><p>If the study involves participants in dependent or <strong>subordinate</strong> position to experimenter:</p><ul><li>Students of experimenter</li><li>Children of experimenter</li></ul><p><br></p><p>This is only allowed to happen if the teacher doesn't know who said yes/no.</p><p><br></p><h3 id="knowledge">Knowledge</h3><p>If the study involves participants that take part <strong>without their knowledge:</strong></p><ul><li>Covert observation</li><li>Gathering of data without knowledge</li></ul><p><br></p><p>By law you'd be allowed to film in public spaces but in minimal risk research studies you shouldn't do this.</p><p><br></p><h3 id="deceiving-participants">Deceiving participants</h3><p>If the study actively involves deceiving participants:</p><ul><li>Deliberately falsely informing participants</li><li>Withholding information in such a way that they are likely to object or show unease when debriefed</li></ul><p><br></p><p>This does not mean you always need to tell everything about the aims of your study.</p><ul><li><strong>Deceiving:</strong> Telling people you are studying facial expressions when you are really interested in what they say</li><li><strong>Not deceiving:</strong> Telling people you are filming them without mentioning you are specifically interested in facial expressions</li></ul><p><br></p><h3 id="sensitive-personal-data">Sensitive personal data</h3><p>If the study collects <strong>sensitive </strong>personal data:</p><ul><li>Financial data</li><li>Location data</li><li>Data relating to children or other vulnerable groups</li><li>Religion</li><li>Race</li><li>Health</li><li>Sexual life</li><li>Political preference</li><li>Genetic and biometric data</li><li>Criminal offenses</li></ul><p><br></p><p>You could ask this but there would need to be a really good reason for it.</p><p><br></p><h3 id="substances">Substances</h3><p>If the study administers drugs, placebos or other <strong>substances</strong>. In HCI you are likely not asking this.</p><p><br></p><h3 id="blood-/-tissue-samples">Blood / tissue samples</h3><p>If in the study,  blood / tissue samples are collected or there will be pain or more than discomfort, the study is not minimal risk.</p><p><br></p><h3 id="psychological-risk">Psychological risk</h3><p>If the study risks psychological stress or anxiety beyond normally encountered</p><p><br></p><p>Main question: will you induce anxiety which people would not also risk in daily life? For example:</p><ul><li>Showing people news clips: okay</li><li>Putting people in anxiety inducing situations they would otherwise never be in: not okay</li></ul><p><br></p><h3 id="financial-compensation">Financial compensation</h3><p>If the study involves financial inducement other than time/travel compensation:</p><ul><li>Paying people for their time: okay</li><li>Giving them much more: not okay</li></ul><p><br></p><h3 id="collecting-identifiable-data">Collecting identifiable data</h3><p>If the study collects identifiable data (e.g. video, pictures, full names). If you still need this requires extra care in how you handle the data.</p><p><br></p><h3 id="uncertified-devices">Uncertified devices</h3><p>If the study uses uncertified devices (you may be testing out a new product that you designed).</p><p><br></p><p>Relevant for research on new (home-built) devices. However, computers, commercial robots &amp; phones are not a problem</p><p><br></p><h2 id="informed-consent">Informed consent</h2><p>Informed consent’s main purpose:</p><ul><li>Know &amp; understand what you will have to do</li><li>Understand the conditions under which you agree (i.e. what rights you have)</li><li>Understand what data will be collected and how it is stored (i.e. how long, available for who)</li></ul><p><br></p><p>It can look as follows:</p><ul><li>Purpose of the research<strong> </strong>- to the extent that your research is not affected</li><li>Benefits and risks of participating - why is it important and are there any risks?</li><li>Procedures for withdrawal from the study - the experimenter doesn't need to know why</li><li>Whether any personal information about the participant will be collected, processed and how and for what purpose; the right of the participant to request access to and rectification or erasure of personal data</li><li>Usage of the data during research, safeguarding personal information, maintaining confidentiality and de-identifying (anonymising) data, controlled access to data, especially in relation to data archiving and reuse, ways of dissemination, data archiving and possible publishing</li><li>Retention period for the research data, or if that is not possible, criteria used to determine that period</li><li>Contact details of the researcher (or his/her representative), contact details of the data protection officer, institution, funding source, how to file a complaint.</li></ul><p><br></p><h2 id="ethics-procedure">Ethics procedure</h2><ul><li>Fill in TU Delft HREC Checklist</li><li>Describe what you will be doing with whom</li><li>Describe possible foreseen risks, and what you will do to reduce them</li><li>Make an informed consent-form</li></ul><p><br></p><h1 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h1><p>Evaluation is a part of the process, it's not about just evaluating the final product. Evaluation is part of a cycle: even after releases you have updates which need to be evaluated as well.</p><p><br></p><p>It involves asking yourself</p><ul><li>Does this do what it was meant to do?</li><li>What works better?</li><li>What doesn't work?</li><li>What effect does it have?</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Before you start evaluating, the following questions need to be answered:</p><div style="white-space: normal;" class="markdown-body"><table>

Therefore it may still be better to do heuristic evaluation.</p><p><br></p><h3 id="heuristic-evaluation">Heuristic evaluation</h3><p>Experts (about 5) independently evaluate the user interface whether it conforms to established usability principles (heuristics, <a href="http://cshub.nl/post/442766138#design-principles" target="_blank">see lecture 3</a>):</p><ul><li>The evaluation lasts about 1 or 2 hours</li><li>Method can be applied on paper prototypes</li><li>Output of the evaluation is a list of usability problems in the interface with reference to usability principles that were violated</li></ul><p><br></p><p>After finding these problems, you use a severity matrix to help you prioritize problems: how much impact does a problem have on the usability / likeability of an application?</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/0uVbPYu.png" width="303"></p><p>Ideally:</p><ul><li>The experts are not the designers of the systems. </li><li>You'd evaluate it with 5 experts in parallel, fix stuff and do another round. However, when doing sequential evaluation you may require more rounds.</li><li>You'd use concrete examples &amp; personas</li></ul><p><br></p><h2 id="data-analytics">Data analytics</h2><p>Here you look at how things are used instead of asking end users. It's very objective and easy to gather. However, it may not be very useful and privacy infringing. Besides, it doesn't tell you why this behavior exists.</p><p><br></p><h3 id="connections">Connections</h3><p>We can use correlations to find connections between data. There may be a connection to user age and time spent for example.</p><p><br></p><p>However, correlation does not always equal causation.</p><p><br></p><h3 id="heat-map">Heat map</h3><p>Using click data, mouse-movement and scroll data we can create a heat map of a product:</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/1pCR6Yg.png" width="272"></p><p><br></p><p>This would answer the question whether people find the items that we find important, and find out where a process goes wrong.</p><p><br></p><h3 id="eye-tracking">Eye tracking</h3><p>If you have eye-tracking data you can make a better heat map, however this is not easy to obtain.</p><p><br></p><p>It shows where all attention goes and how long this attention is retained.</p><p><br></p><h3 id="quantified-self">Quantified self</h3><p>These are personal analytics: you define yourself by collecting statistics. Examples of this are smart watches.</p><p><br></p><h3 id="sentiment-analysis">Sentiment analysis</h3><p>You may get sentiment from text, using text processing. You obtain the opinions, beliefs, emotions and sentiments from the text.</p>
