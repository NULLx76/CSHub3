The teams also regularly reflect on how they can be more effective.</p><p><br></p><h2 id="scrum">Scrum</h2><p>Scrum is an iterative agile framework, which is based around sprints:</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LtohynH.png" width="380"></p><p><em>Image taken from slides by Mauricio Aniche</em></p><p><br></p><p>There are a few roles:</p><ul><li><strong>Product Owner (PO):</strong> maintains the backlog, communicates with the development team, bridges between the customer and the development team</li><li><strong>Scrum Master</strong>: educates teams on the process, helps to keep the team on track and improve the process, removes impediments (hindrances)</li><li><strong>Development team: </strong>develops the product, raise impediments, reflects and adapts</li></ul><p><br></p><p>A sprint is an iteration, which takes about 2 to 4 weeks and produces a potentially shippable product. Deciding on what to do in a sprint is done during <strong>sprint planning</strong>:</p><ul><li>The PO presents the most important item of the backlog (a prioritized list of to do's, can be bug reports or features).</li><li>The team discusses the item and estimates the required effort</li><li>Repeat until sprint is full</li></ul><p><br></p><p>The team can estimate the required effort out of experience, empirical data or using <strong>planning poker. </strong>In planning poker, all team members simultaneously show a card that represents their estimate of that feature after the PO presented it. The authors with the lowest and highest estimation explain why, and we repeat this until a consensus is reached.</p><p><br></p><p>The features can be broken down into small tasks which should be highly technical (here the PO is not involved anymore), to aid the development afterwards. Using the Kanban board you can see which developer has picked up which task and what the status is of these tasks.</p><p><br></p><p>The team will have a short <strong>daily meeting</strong> in order to make sure everyone is on the same track.</p><p><br></p><p>In the end the team will do a <strong>sprint review</strong> with the PO:</p><ul><li>The team presents the results of the sprint to the PO</li><li>The PO experiments and evaluates whether the done (the team should define what "done" means) features meet the acceptance criteria</li><li>The PO may propose to add new ideas to the backlog</li><li>The PO and the team decide to ship the current version or not</li></ul><p><br></p><p>The team also does a <strong>sprint retrospective</strong>:</p><ul><li>The team reflects about its behavior</li><li>The team decides on actionable points</li><li>The team reviews improvement from the last retrospective</li></ul><p><br></p>
