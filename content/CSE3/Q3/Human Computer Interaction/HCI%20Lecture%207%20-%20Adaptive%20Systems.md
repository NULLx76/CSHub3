<h1 id="adaptive-systems">Adaptive systems</h1><p>Adaptive systems are systems which adapt and respond to the user and/or their environment. Even websites are adaptive systems.</p><p><br></p><p>However, some systems react much more: AI.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Levels of adaptivity:</strong></p><ol><li>Produce change in output depending on input (e.g. clicking a button)</li><li>Respond to sequences of input – so has some ‘memory’ (e.g. if you clicked on a button and then on the 'help' button and change what you show based on that)</li><li>Monitor effect of adaptation and evaluate/change based on this. So you change your response based on the reaction.</li><li>Has internal model of the interaction and adapt based on expected effect. Here you try to predict what will happen in the future and change your response based on that.</li><li>Has higher-level reasoning, can change the internal models of interactions</li></ol><p><br></p><h1 id="agents">Agents</h1><p><strong>Agents</strong> are autonomous, active computer processes with some ability to communicate and adapt their behavior. All adaptive systems can be viewed as agents.</p><p><br></p><p>Intelligent agents can have a range of different architectures. The important thing is that they have knowledge about <strong>what they want to adapt to, what they want to adapt, and how.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>They combine person models (or more commonly known as user models) and domain models into a model of interaction:</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ll90oqx.png" width="184"></p><p><br></p><h2 id="domain-model"><strong>Domain model</strong></h2><p>If you want to adapt to your environment, you need to have some representation of that environment and what aspects mean what adaptation.</p><p><br></p><p>Some possible levels of description:</p><ul><li><strong>Physical:</strong> physical characteristics</li><li><strong>Conceptual: </strong>concepts such as 'button'</li><li><strong>Intentional: </strong>the purpose, such as urgency, topic</li></ul><p><br></p><h2 id="user-model">User model</h2><p>At its simplest: an adaptive system responds to what a person does. Input-output.</p><p><br></p><p>However, you usually want to be at a higher level using knowledge and abstractions, e.g. by asking the user about knowledge you need but don't have.</p><p><br></p><p>You need an <strong>understanding of that user</strong> and what their <strong>characteristics/actions mean</strong> for how you adapt.</p><p><br></p><p>There are a couple of characteristics you can use to understand your users:</p><p><br></p><h3 id="emotion">Emotion</h3><p>Emotion can be viewed in different ways:</p><ul><li>Discrete set of human emotions (you can see here that some emotions are opposite)</li></ul><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/uOcYrbV.png" width="246"></p><ul><li>Emotions based on valence (negative-positive) &amp; arousal (energy level)</li></ul><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/bajfEfQ.png" width="256"></p><p><br></p><p>There are many different ways to measure emotions, which can be apparent to people (facial expressions, voice intonation) or less apparent to people (respiration, heart rate).</p><p><br></p><h3 id="personality">Personality</h3><p>Personality is the the combination of characteristics or qualities that form an individual's distinctive character.</p><p><br></p><p>There are two ways of looking at personality:</p><ul><li><strong>Types:</strong> everyone is one type</li><li><strong>Traits:</strong> everyone falls somewhere along a line of traits</li></ul><p><br></p><p>You can use the Meyers-Briggs model to describe personality. It shows you your type with underlying traits.</p><p><br></p><p>It is very popular online but not in academia (since it's not necessarily valid, reliable, independent &amp; comprehensive):</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/1PPFXRd.png" width="449"></p><p><br></p><p>In academia, we use the "Big 5 personality model", which uses traits which combined define your personality:</p><ul><li><strong>Openness:</strong> are you open to experience, imagination</li><li><strong>Neuroticism: </strong>the tendency to experience negative emotions</li><li><strong>Conscientiousness</strong>: do you like order, control, will to achieve &amp; are you ambitious</li><li><strong>Agreeableness: </strong>kindness, altruism, trust, modesty</li><li><strong>Extra-version: </strong>interpersonal dimension, warmth, sociability</li></ul><p><br></p><h3 id="norms">Norms</h3><p><strong>Norms </strong>are social rules for behavior, and differ per society, culture and person. Norms can conflict!</p><p><br></p><p>Violating a norm typically has social consequences.</p><p><br></p><p>E.g.:</p><ul><li>On meeting someone, shake hands</li><li>In times of pandemic: avoid all contact</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Norms are not habits</strong>! (breaking those has no consequence). They are based on values</p><p><br></p><h3 id="values">Values</h3><p>Values are theoretical concepts that we find important in life. We also use them to judge our own and others actions.</p><p><br></p><p>If you value <span class="ql-formula" data-value="x">﻿<span contenteditable="false"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.43056em; vertical-align: 0em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">x</span></span></span></span></span>﻿</span> you may look up to people who have that.</p><p><br></p><h2 id="interaction-modality">Interaction modality</h2><p>Now we know how to adapt to, we need to find a way to actually adapt (e.g. what you show on a page).</p><p><br></p><h3 id="language">Language</h3><p>Applicable when your system interacts with users via language (e.g. chatbot, text info on a page).</p><p><br></p><p>You can adapt in terms of:</p><ul><li><strong>What you say</strong> (e.g. adapt based on the query of the user)</li><li><strong>How you say it </strong>(e.g. adapt the speed, pitch, tone, accept and word choice)</li><li><strong>When you say it </strong>(e.g. immediate, wait a bit, wait until the problem is fixed)</li></ul><p><br></p><h3 id="embodiment">Embodiment</h3><p>You can also adapt to your user using your body, e.g. using:</p><ul><li>Movement</li><li>Gesture</li><li>Affect</li></ul><p><br></p><h1 id="evaluating-adaptive-systems">Evaluating adaptive systems</h1><h2 id="wizard-of-oz">Wizard of Oz</h2><p>Sometimes you want to evaluate a functionality of a system without all other functionalities being present.</p><p><br></p><p>Here, the human simulates the system's intelligence and interacts with the user, who is using a real or mock interface as they expected to if it were an actual system.</p><p><br></p><p>The "wizard" interprets inputs based on an algorithm and makes sure the computer / screen behaves in an appropriate manner. <strong>What the wizard is simulating isn’t the core of your study!</strong></p><p><br></p><h3 id="advantages"><strong>Advantages</strong></h3><ul><li>Adding simulated and complex vertical functionality</li><li>Testing futuristic ideas</li><li>Testing premises without full implementation being necessary</li></ul><p><br></p><h3 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h3><ul><li>A human wizard will never fully function as the system would, so:</li><li>Unexpected changes in true system capability are not taken into account</li></ul><p><br></p><p>To limit these drawbacks, there is a "wizard protocol" so that the wizard acts as much as possible like the eventual system:</p><ul><li>Think about what the wizard can observe</li><li>Limit the action space of the wizard to that of the later system</li><li>Describe, in detail, how observation leads to action</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Wizarding components which can be built with current technology are easier to describe than future technology!</p><p><br></p><h3 id="example">Example</h3><p><em>Imagine the wizard acts as speech-to-text</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>What the wizard can observe</strong>: the speech of the user, in audio format only. (no visual)</p><p><strong>What the wizard can do</strong>: type in text in textbox.</p><p><strong>Protocol of the wizard</strong>: type in exactly what the user says. Include pauses, ‘ehs’ etc.</p><p><br></p><h2 id="layered-evaluation">Layered evaluation</h2><p>In layered evaluation, you treat adaptation as multiple constituents (layers) instead of viewing it as a singular process.</p><p><br></p><p>You evaluate each layer separately where necessary and feasible. In a WoOz design, you simulate one layer while evaluating another!</p><ul><li>A WoOz only works in layered evaluation</li><li>But not all layered evaluations need a Wizard</li></ul><p><br></p><h3 id="advantages">Advantages</h3><ul><li>Offers guidance for possible studies (“separation of concerns”)</li><li>Helps to identify problems and wrong assumptions</li><li>Guides development process (formative evaluation)</li><li>Sometimes you need to have some minimal insurance of quality</li></ul><p><br></p><h3 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h3><p>The whole can be more than the sum of its parts</p><ul><li>Parts might interact in unexpected ways</li><li>The overall effect cannot always be predicted if you only know what the parts do</li></ul><p><br></p><p>You first determine what layers to evaluate and when each layer is successful:</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NUkEusW.png" width="396"></p><p><br></p><h2 id="input-data">Input data</h2><p>If an adaptive system records input data, we can use the following cycle to analyze and act upon this input data:</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/y9SmBdc.png" width="209"></p><p><br></p><p>It is important to look at the big picture, and at the different layers.</p><p><br></p><p>For the big picture, you ask yourself whether the system achieves its goals, whether it improves interaction and whether users like the system. This can be judged on effectiveness, efficiency, usability and system specific criteria.</p><p><br></p><h3 id="collection">Collection</h3><p>An adaptive system may observes user behaviour and context, e.g., click stream, input, sensor data, etc. If this data collection is incorrect, it will be very hard to properly adapt, so checking this input data is very important.</p><p><br></p><p>You ask yourself if user behavior is registered correctly. This can be judged on reliability, accuracy and latency.</p><p><br></p><h3 id="interpretation">Interpretation</h3><p>Adaptive systems interpret the recorded behaviour, giving meaning to raw data. This is sometimes very trivial (a "next" button for example) but it can also require inference and assumptions.</p><p><br></p><p>You ask yourself if the users are doing what the system thinks they are doing. This can be judged on validity.</p><p><br></p><h3 id="modelling-the-state-of-the-world">Modelling the state of the world</h3><p>Based on observations the system infers the current state of the world, e.g., user model, context model. Usually this is the AI component of the system (Bayesian network, rules, etc)</p><p><br></p><p>You ask for yourself whether the model reflects the real world and whether the world is modeled in an appropriate way. This can be judged on validity.</p><p><br></p><h3 id="decide-upon-adaptation">Decide upon adaptation</h3><p>Adaptive Systems decide which adaptation theory/strategy to apply given the current user model.</p><p><br></p><p>You ask yourself whether it is necessary to intervene and the system selected a good and appropriate adaptation strategy. This can be judged on necessity, appropriateness, subjective acceptance.</p><p><br></p><h3 id="apply-adaptation">Apply adaptation</h3><p>The adaptation decision can be applied in different ways.</p><p><br></p><p>You can ask yourself whether the concrete instantiation of the adaptation decision is working and whether users understand what it means. This can be judged on usability, obtrusiveness, acceptance, timeliness and user control.</p>
