<h1 id="envisionment">Envisionment</h1><p><strong>Envisionment</strong> is thinking about how something might look light. It deals with externalizing your thoughts.</p><p><strong>Design </strong>is both the process of envisioning a solution to a problem under constraints and the <em>representations </em>of the product that are produced during the design process.</p><p><br></p><h2 id="prototyping">Prototyping</h2><p>Prototyping is the phase of representing designs. You may make them for yourself, colleagues in a design team, programmers etc.</p><p><br></p><p>A prototype is a "working" model with the look and functionality of the envisaged product. It could be a mock-up, model, or actual working version (depending on who you are making the prototype for).</p><p><br></p><h3 id="why?">Why?</h3><p>You perform prototyping to:</p><ul><li>effectively communicate with each other</li><li>hold, see and interact with a prototype</li><li>test out ideas yourself and encourage reflection</li><li>answer questions and support designers in choosing between alternatives</li></ul><p><br></p><h3 id="what?">What?</h3><p>You may prototype technical issues, workflows, tasks, screen layouts, difficult, controversial or critical areas.</p><p><br></p><h3 id="how?">How?</h3><p>There are a few choices in prototyping:</p><ul><li><strong>Fidelity: </strong>the degree of exactness with which something is copied or reproduced</li><li><strong>Horizontal</strong> (#features, broad view of the application) / <strong>vertical</strong> (functionality of features) scenario</li><li><strong>Completeness</strong></li><li class="ql-indent-1"><strong>Evolutionary: </strong>robust prototype that is refined to eventually become the final product</li><li class="ql-indent-1"><strong>Incremental: </strong>product built as separate components, which are prototyped and tested individually</li><li class="ql-indent-1"><strong>Throwaway: </strong>cheap prototype that can be discarded, used to elicit user reaction</li></ul><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4vpwUm4.png" width="396"></p><p><br></p><h2 id="low-fidelity-prototype">Low fidelity prototype</h2><p>A low fidelity prototype is focused on broad design (content, form) and is produced and thrown away quickly. They aid in many design solutions. They can be sketches, models, mock-ups or a limited implementation.</p><p><br></p><p>You use low fidelity prototyping because they don't take a long time to create and change, can stay ambiguous and can reproduce any platform. It also requires minimal skill in order to make and understand them.</p><p><br></p><h3 id="storyboarding">Storyboarding</h3><p>An example of a low fidelity prototype is storyboarding: a series of key frames that show how a user might progress through a task using the device. It is often used with scenarios, bringing more detail and a chance to role play. It is used in early design.</p><p><br></p><p>It mostly shows you the situations someone might use your application and thus provides insight into how the application should comply with these use cases. </p><p><br></p><p>There are different types of storyboard shots:</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/aXJcU7r.png" width="397"> </p><p>It can also be used to depict <strong>user journeys:</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/eA1Dtwk.png" width="500"></p><p><br></p><h3 id="paper-prototypes">Paper prototypes</h3><p>Paper prototypes are the most common &amp; useful ways to go about it (for example using storyboards). They are a quick and cheap way to prepare and modify your prototype.</p><p><br></p><p>They might be used to brainstorm competing representations, elicit user reactions, modifications and suggestions.</p><p><br></p><p>However, some problems might be:</p><ul><li><strong>Robustness:</strong> it may not be strong enough for many people will handle it</li><li><strong>Scope: </strong> it needs to solve broad issues and key elements</li><li><strong>Instructions: </strong>needs to be simple and clear, without just giving all directions</li><li><strong>Flexibility: </strong>you must make sure it can be changed on the fly</li></ul><p><br></p><h3 id="sketches">Sketches</h3><p>Sketches can help you capture your initial ideas. Since the sketches will be quite crude, people will focus on high level concepts instead of details, but this also makes it hard to envision how a user would eventually use the product.</p><p><br></p><h3 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h3><p>Yet another low fidelity prototype, focuses on the structure and navigation of the application. They don't worry about the final details.</p><p><br></p><h3 id="pictive">Pictive</h3><p>This is a paper mockup that helps you design multiple layers of sticky notes and plastic overlays to create a paper mockup. It is a representation of a GUI on paper, which gives the user an idea how it would actually look like when finished. The advantage is that it lowers the barrier to participation.</p><p><br></p><p>All UI components will be pre-made components on paper, so you can easily change the location of for example a button:</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rWAoFLJ.png" width="419"></p><p><br></p><p>These sessions will be recorded to further analyze later.</p><p><br></p><h2 id="medium-fidelity-prototypes">Medium fidelity prototypes</h2><p>Medium fidelity prototypes simulate or animate some but not all features of the intended system. They are often prototyped using a computer and built on top of wireframes.</p><p><br></p><p>They provides a more sophisticated experience that tests more subtle design issues and a development path. They are excellent for showing look and feel, but are still constrained to limited functionality.</p><p><br></p><p>When people are interacting with a system, not all faults may be communicated explicitly. When interacting with a medium fidelity prototype, we can hopefully elicit an explicit reaction from the user. However, users may be reluctant to challenge the design and the design may think this to be the real design.</p><p><br></p><p>For medium fidelity prototypes we need to make a trade-off between a horizontal &amp; vertical prototype:</p><ul><li><strong>Vertical prototypes: </strong>includes in-depth functionality for only a few selected features</li><li><strong>Horizontal prototypes: </strong>the surface layer includes the entire user interface with no underlying functionality</li></ul><p><br></p><p>To decide, we make a <strong>scenario / script, </strong>which fixes the usage of the system.</p><p><br></p><h3 id="types-of-medium-fidelity-prototypes">Types of medium fidelity prototypes</h3><p><strong>Painting / drawing packages: </strong>you draw each storyboard scene on a computer, which yields a thin horizontal prototype since it probably will not have functionality</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Scripted simulations and slide shows: </strong>give the user a very tight script / task to follow, so the system appears to behave as a real system. They will then interact with simple hardcoded storyboard transitions activated by user inputs</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Wizard of Oz: </strong>you may not want to deal with technical details at this point in time, so a human may simulate the system's intelligence and interact with the user: the user uses a computer as expected and the "wizard" interprets the subjects' input according to an algorithm and has the screen behave in an appropriate manner.</p><p><br></p><h2 id="high-fidelity-prototypes">High fidelity prototypes</h2><p>These prototypes uses materials that you would expect to see in the final product. They look and feel more like the final system and they are the final step before the final implementation.</p><p><br></p><p>Just like for medium fidelity prototypes, you risk that stakeholders think there already is a final system.</p><p><br></p><p>High fidelity prototypes are meant to be impressive to clients, show the complete design and detail and reproduce an appropriate amount of interaction.</p><p><br></p><h2 id="comparison">Comparison</h2><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Y08a64G.png" width="495"></p>
