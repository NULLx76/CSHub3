<h1 id="requirements-">Requirements </h1><p>A <strong>requirement</strong> is something the product must do or a quality that the product must have. Requirement specifications can include prototypes, screenshots and other media.</p><p><br></p><p>When written they should be clear, unambiguous, and framed so that it will be possible to test whether the requirement has been met in the final system.</p><p><br></p><h2 id="types-of-requirements">Types of requirements</h2><p><strong>Functional requirements: </strong>what the system must do</p><p><strong>Non-functional requirements: </strong>qualities that the system must have</p><ul><li>can affect the acceptability, sale or usage</li><li>cover different aspects of design (e.g., usability, UX, performance, maintainability, security, cultural acceptability, legal restrictions)</li></ul><p><br></p><h2 id="prioritizing-requirements">Prioritizing requirements</h2><p>MoSCoW rules, you know the drill by now:</p><ul><li><strong>Must have</strong>: fundamental requirements;

You can ask yourselves the following questions to check your labels:</p><ul><li>Do labels match?</li><li>Do you have a reasonable number of categories? Not too few or too many?</li><li>Are categories the right size?</li><li>Does each label have several members?</li><li>Is any category in need of further sub-categorizing?</li></ul><p><br></p><p>You may not want to use labels, depending on:</p><ul><li>How much space there is on the button</li><li>How bored the designer is with the current labels</li></ul><p><br></p><h3 id="card-sorting">Card Sorting</h3><p>Card sorting is a technique used to gain an understanding of how the user thinks information should be organized.

Evaluate with focus groups, query analysis and user testing.</p><p><br></p><h1 id="navigation">Navigation</h1><p>As mentioned above "<strong>navigation</strong>"<strong> </strong>refers to the presentation of the organization of the site.
