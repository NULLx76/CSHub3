<h1 id="user-experience">User experience</h1><p>User Experience is about developing interactive systems that fit with people and their ways of using your product.</p><p><br></p><h2 id="cross-channel-design">Cross-channel design</h2><p>A lot of systems, don't have a single platform that the user interacts with (phone, desktop, etc). Thus a new system needs to fit is with existing ecosystems and infrastructures.</p><p><br></p><p>Besides this, it is important to also sync up with other apps, such that transitions between touch-points in interaction feel natural across multiple apps. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Trajectories</strong> (how a user navigates) need to be:</p><ul><li>Coherent</li><li>Carefully orchestrated</li><li>Part of a connected whole</li></ul><p><br></p><h3 id="service-blueprint">Service blueprint</h3><p>A <strong>service blueprint</strong> maps out the touch-points and to find out how your system connects with other interfaces (e.g. devices, other people).</p><p><br></p><p>The main objective here is to map the interaction between multiple systems if you are using cross-channel design.</p><p><br></p><p>Here you can see that you first have customer actions (e.g. log-in), then an employee may have to take an action, etc:</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yN4Ydo6.png" width="489"></p><p><br></p><h2 id="user-journeys">User journeys</h2><p>Another way to figure out how an <strong>individual, specific user</strong> uses a system, you can use user journeys. These help you find flaws in where things can go wrong on the user side.</p><p><br></p><p>This can also be across channels (e.g. user gets up to get another device).</p><p><br></p><p>In a user journey, you map the following:</p><ul><li>How the customer interacts with the product (<strong>interaction stage</strong>)</li><li>What happens internally after this action (<strong>internal process</strong>)</li><li>The actions &amp; emotions of a user</li><li>What went wrong and how this can be improved</li></ul><p><br></p><p>An example of this can be found here:</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vINXvcB.png" width="595"></p><p>As you can see, a very important part of the user journey is the experience / emotions of the users.</p><p><br></p><p>These user journey maps can include:</p><ul><li>Customer actions</li><li>Customer thoughts / internal process</li><li>Stage in interaction</li><li>Interface at that stage</li><li>Experience / emotion</li><li>Customer goal</li><li>Potential for improvement</li></ul><p><br></p><h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h2><p>There are many types of ways a system is not accessible for some users:</p><ul><li>Physically - e.g. ATM too high for someone in a wheelchair</li><li>Conceptually - e.g. instructions are too difficult</li><li>Economically - e.g. an app only works on the latest version of a phone</li><li>Culturally - e.g. someone that may not get metaphors because they grew up in a different culture</li><li>Socially - e.g. only available during working hours</li></ul><p><br></p><h3 id="inclusivity-analysis">Inclusivity analysis</h3><p>Inclusivity analysis is a way to figure out if you have an accessibility problem. Sometimes you may have to choose between different improvements, since you don't have the resources to implement all of them.</p><p><br></p><p>This graph helps you figure out whether you should/don't necessarily need to implement this improvement now.</p><p><br></p><p>It is read as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Stability:</strong> does the disability come and go (a cold) or is it always there (blindness)?</li><li><strong>Incidence: </strong>how often does this disability occur?</li><li><strong>Solution</strong>: how expensive is the solution to the problem (mostly expressed in time investment)?</li><li><strong>Possible recommendation: </strong>should I implement this?</li></ul><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UBQwTAC.png" width="590"></p><h2 id="universal-design">Universal design</h2><p>We can use the following design principles to check whether our design is usable for a large range of different users.</p><p><br></p><h3 id="equitable-use">Equitable use</h3><p>We want to design for <strong>equitable use: </strong>the design does not disadvantage or stigmatize any group of users. Treat different people differently to achieve a similar outcome for everyone (also in terms of 'niceness').</p><p><br></p><p>However, you should avoid segregating or stigmatizing any users, and make sure that privacy and safety should be equally available for all users.</p><p><br></p><h3 id="flexibility-in-use">Flexibility in use</h3><p>The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities:</p><ul><li>Provide a choice in which methods to use</li><li>Accommodate right- or left-handed access and use</li><li>Facilitate the user's accuracy and precision</li><li>Provide adaptability to the user's pace</li></ul><p><br></p><h3 id="simple-and-intuitive-use">Simple and intuitive use</h3><p>The use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user's experience, knowledge, language skills or current concentration level:</p><ul><li>Eliminate unnecessary complexity</li><li>Be consistent with user expectations and intuition</li><li>Accommodate a wide range of literacy and language skills</li><li>Arrange information consistent with its importance</li><li>Provide effective prompting and feedback during and after task completion (show people what they are doing)</li></ul><p><br></p><h3 id="perceptible-information">Perceptible information</h3><p>The design communicates necessary information effectively for the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities:</p><ul><li>Use different modes for redundant presentation of essential information</li><li>Provide adequate contrast between essential information and its surroundings</li><li>Maximize "legibility" of essential information</li><li>Differentiate elements in ways that can be described (make it easy to give instructions or directions)</li><li>Provide compatibility with a variety of techniques or device used by people with sensory limitations</li></ul><p><br></p><h3 id="tolerance-for-error">Tolerance for error</h3><p>The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions:</p><ul><li>Arrange elements to minimize hazards and errors: most used elements are the most accessible and the most hazardous elements are eliminated, isolated or shielded</li><li>Provide warnings of hazards and errors</li><li>Provide fail safe features</li><li>Discourage unconscious action in tasks that require vigilance</li></ul><p><br></p><h3 id="low-physical-effort">Low physical effort</h3><p>The design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with minimum fatigue:</p><ul><li>Allow the user to maintain a neutral body position</li><li>Use reasonable (depends on the person) operating forces</li><li>Minimize repetitive actions</li><li>Minimize sustained physical effort</li></ul><p><br></p><h3 id="size-and-space-for-approach-and-use">Size and space for approach and use</h3><p>Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation and use regardless of the user's body size, posture or mobility:</p><ul><li>Provide a clear line of sight to important elements for any seated or standing user</li><li>Make reach to all components comfortable for any seated or standing user</li><li>Accommodate variations in hand and grip size</li><li>Provide adequate space for the use of assistive devices or personal assistance</li></ul><p><br></p><h2 id="usability">Usability</h2><p>A system with high usability is efficient, effective, easy, safe and high utility. It concerns itself with how people, aided by technology perform certain tasks.</p><p><br></p><p>We can measure usability using the <strong>system usability scale (SUS), </strong>also called the "quick and dirty usability scale". It contains 10 items that are graded on the 5 point <strong>Likert scale </strong>(strongly disagree, ..., strongly agree).</p><p><br></p><p>This SUS will give you a score (note that you need to invert the score of questions phrasing something negative), which is hard to interpret exactly. </p><p>Generally, we can use the following table (though keep in mind this may differ from case to case):</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gSIqgJb.png" width="243"></p><p>The best way to use the SUS is to compare systems: has my system improved?</p><p><br></p><h2 id="design-principles">Design principles</h2><p>Design principles explain the aspects a good interactive system should pay attention to.</p><p><br></p><p>They guide the design and evaluation of usability:</p><ul><li>Accessing, learning &amp; remembering:</li><li class="ql-indent-1"><strong>Visibility:</strong> the important information / where people need to click needs to be visible</li><li class="ql-indent-1"><strong>Consistency:</strong> be consistent in terms of font &amp; the meanings of certain elements throughout the entire system</li><li class="ql-indent-1"><strong>Familiarity: </strong>use the things that are familiar to people</li><li class="ql-indent-1"><strong>Affordance: </strong>make things look like that they are meant to do</li><li>Control:</li><li class="ql-indent-1"><strong>Navigation: </strong>make sure people are find what they are looking for</li><li class="ql-indent-1"><strong>Control: </strong>give people the idea that they are in control and understand what they are doing</li><li class="ql-indent-1"><strong>Feedback: </strong>tell people what is going on</li><li>Safety &amp; security:</li><li class="ql-indent-1"><strong>Recovery: </strong>if certain actions have high impact, people should be able to reverse these actions</li><li class="ql-indent-1"><strong>Constraints: </strong>make sure people can't do actions they are not able to do</li><li>Suitability:</li><li class="ql-indent-1"><strong>Flexibility:</strong> give people different options to do something</li><li class="ql-indent-1"><strong>Style:</strong> if it looks good it'll be nicer to use</li><li class="ql-indent-1"><strong>Conviviality:</strong> be nice to users, e.g. when asking "would you like to do this?". Embracing humor is a good idea, people will be much less irritated if a small joke is incorporated.</li></ul><p><br></p><h3 id="loading-bar">Loading bar</h3><p>A loading bar that goes on for a long time without any signs of progress is very bad design.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4FFKUZl.png" width="158"></p><p>Some important things that you should do:</p><ul><li>Let people know what they are waiting for</li><li>Make the loading bar fit with the rest of your design scheme</li><li>Always include a true timeframe (don't stop at 99%)</li><li>Use animations to make it dynamic</li><li>Users should be able to pause or cancel the loading process</li><li>Make the last part of the loading process the fastest</li></ul><p><br></p><h3 id="error-messages">Error messages</h3><p>Error messages should always contain: </p><ul><li>What the problem was</li><li>Why it happened</li><li>How to solve it</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Be specific!</p><p><br></p><h2 id="acceptability">Acceptability</h2><p>Acceptability concerns with the question whether the product fits in people's lives and whether they actually want to use it.</p><p><br></p><p>There are a few aspects that affect this:</p><ul><li><strong>Political acceptability: </strong>what type of technology would be politically acceptable</li><li><strong>Convenience: </strong>what type of technology is convenient for your personality</li><li><strong>Cultural and social habits: </strong>think of technology which is acceptable in one culture, but not in another</li><li><strong>Usefulness: </strong>does it add something? What would be useful to you, but not to your parents? (or the other way around)</li><li><strong>Economic: </strong>pricing (is it acceptable to pay <span class="ql-formula" data-value="x">﻿<span contenteditable="false"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.43056em; vertical-align: 0em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">x</span></span></span></span></span>﻿</span> for this product), does it fit within the business model?</li></ul><p><br></p><h3 id="technology-acceptance-model">Technology acceptance model</h3><p>These previous points are kind of hard to predict since they pertain to a user's personal life instead of how the technology works.</p><p><br></p><p>The technology acceptance model describes how in practice users accept and use a system.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/1qvfPMS.png" width="664"></p><ul><li><strong>Perceived ease of use:</strong> how easy is it to use? This is something you can design for</li><li><strong>Perceived usefulness:</strong> how useful is it? This is also something you can design for</li><li><strong>External variables: </strong>you don't know always know these</li><li><strong>Attitude towards use: </strong>what people <em>think</em> they will do. This will be high if it's easy &amp; useful, and vice-versa</li><li><strong>Intention to use: </strong>what people <em>plan </em>to do. Perceived usefulness will be very important here</li><li><strong>Actual usage: </strong>what people <em>actually</em> do</li></ul><p><br></p><h2 id="value-sensitive-design">Value-sensitive design</h2><p>"Value sensitive design seeks to provide theory and method to account for human values in a principled and systematic manner throughout the design process."</p><p><br></p><p>There are lots of values which conflict with each other:</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/T5Ntnkt.png" width="671"></p><p>Value sensitive design now aims to:</p><ol><li>Translate a general value into one or more general norms ("prescriptions for, and restrictions on action"</li><li>Translate these norms to more specific design requirements</li></ol><p><br></p><p>These decisions are made together with your stakeholders.</p><p><br></p><p>This can be seen here:</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xoVVApc.png" width="637"></p><p><br></p><h2 id="experience">Experience</h2><p>You want a system to be memorable, satisfying, enjoyable and rewarding. E-books may have a lot of advantages, but some people still may prefer a paper book because of the experience.</p><p><br></p><p>A key part of this is engagement:</p><ul><li><strong>Identity</strong>: a sense of authenticity</li><li><strong>Adaptivity</strong>: personalized change</li><li><strong>Narrative</strong>: telling a story</li><li><strong>Immersion</strong>: feeling you’re wholly involved</li><li><strong>Flow</strong>: smooth transition between states</li></ul><p><br></p><h3 id="gamification">Gamification</h3><p>To make something more engaging you can add game elements, <strong>gamification. </strong>For example applying a scoring and competition element.</p><p><br></p><p>Keep in mind that different people like different kinds of games.</p><p><br></p><h3 id="pleasure">Pleasure</h3><p>You can play with pleasure:</p><ul><li>Senses (<strong>physio pleasure</strong>)</li><li>Relationships (<strong>socio pleasure</strong>)</li><li>Cognitive &amp; emotion (<strong>psycho pleasure</strong>)</li><li>Values &amp; aspirations (<strong>ideo pleasure</strong>)</li></ul><p><br></p><h3 id="lifestyle">Lifestyle</h3><p>When people make choices, they fit them into a mindset they have. </p><p>Therefore it is important to design for a specific lifestyle.</p><p><br></p>
