<h1 id="physical-storage">Physical storage</h1><p>A DBMS needs to retrieve, update and process persistently stored data. </p><p><br></p><p>Some important characteristics for the physical storage: <strong>capacity</strong>, <strong>random access time, transfer rate</strong></p><p><br></p><h2 id="storage-characteristics"><strong>Storage characteristics</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Volatile</strong>: memory needs constant power to keep data (<strong>dynamic </strong>= refresh regularly, <strong>static</strong> = no refresh needed)</li><li><strong>Access modes: </strong>random access (any piece of data can be accessed in the same time), sequential access (data can be accessed in sequential order)</li><li><strong>Write mode</strong>: <strong>mutable </strong>storage (can be read and written arbitrarily), Write Once Read Many</li></ul><p><br></p><h2 id="storage-hierarchy"><strong>Storage hierarchy</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Primary storage</strong>: fast, limited capacity, high price</li><li><strong>Secondary storage</strong>: slower, large capacity, lower price</li><li><strong>Tertiary storage</strong>: even slower, huge capacity, even lower price</li></ul><p><br></p><h2 id="hdd"><strong>HDD</strong></h2><p><strong>How does a HDD work?</strong></p><ul><li>Hard disc drives are (still) the standard for large, cheap and persistent storage</li><li>A HDD uses directionally magnetization of a ferromagnetic material</li><li>The hard disk platters have <strong>magnetic regions</strong>, each of which represents 1 bit</li><li>Uses a <strong>read head </strong>(can detect magnetization direction of each region) and a <strong>write head </strong>(can change the direction)</li><li><strong>Sectors </strong>are the smallest transfer unit (1-8 Kb), which are all of the same size, disks have a fixed data density</li><li>Gaps between sectors make 10% of a track, these gaps are not magnetized</li><li>A hard disk uses multiple platters, each platter side is called a <strong>surface. </strong>Each platter is fixed on a main <strong>spindle</strong></li><li>Each surface is divided into <strong>tracks</strong>, all tracks of all surfaces with the same diameter are called <strong>cylinder</strong></li></ul><p><br></p><p>See appendix A for illustrations on this</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Latency in a HDD</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Communication time</strong> between processor and disk controller</li><li><strong>Seektime </strong>time to position the R/W head to the right cylinder</li><li><strong>Rotational delay </strong>until first sector of block appears under R/W head</li><li><strong>Transfer time </strong>during rotation until all sectors and gaps of the requested block have passed the R/W head</li></ol><p><br></p><p><strong>HDD controller</strong></p><ul><li>The <strong>disk controller </strong>organizes low level access to the disk (encoding/decoding, positioning the arm, connects to bus)</li><li>The <strong>host bus adapter </strong>(HBA) bridges between the peripheral bus and system internal bus</li><li><strong>DAS </strong>(Directly Attached Storage)</li><li>Transfers content of whole blocks to buffer (like normal cache but with DB-specific strategies), which resides in <strong>primary storage </strong>and can be accessed efficiently</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Buffering</strong></p><p>DBMS do their own block management to try to get the data required in the main memory to improve speed</p><p><br></p><h1 id="appendix">Appendix</h1><h2 id="a">A</h2><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YzR1XhU.png" width="343"></p><p><em>Image taken from slides by C.
