<h1 id="computer-networks"><span>Computer networks</span></h1><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">A </span><strong style="background-color: transparent;">computer network </strong><span style="background-color: transparent;">is a collection of computers that are able to exchange information. Computer networks are layers of software, each layer is called </span><strong style="background-color: transparent;">middleware.</strong></p><p><br></p><h3 id="goals"><span>Goals</span></h3><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Goals of computer networks:</span></p><ul><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">Resource sharing (making programs available to anyone on the internet)</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">Communication (email, VoIP, etc)</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">eCommerce (Webshops)</span></li></ul><p><br></p><h3 id="forms-"><strong>Forms </strong></h3><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Forms of computer networks:</span></p><ul><li><span>Server-client model (client requests, server responds)</span></li><li><span>Peer-to-peer model (requests and responses between computers, no server in between)</span></li></ul><p><br></p><h1 id="network-hardware"><span>Network hardware</span></h1><h3 id="types-of-transmission-technology"><strong>Types of transmission technology</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Broadcast</strong><span>: the communication channel is shared by all the machines in the network, packets are sent by any machine, are received by all other machines in the network.

E.g. Bluetooth</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Local area networks</strong></p><p><span>Connecting multiple computers with a switch. A switch is a device that has multiple ports connecting to a number of computers. A switch sends incoming packets to the right computer by analyzing the addresses in the packets. Large LANs can be created by using a number of switches plugged into each other or using larger switches</span></p><p><br></p><p><span>Both wireless and wired networks can be divided into </span><strong>static </strong><span>and </span><strong>dynamic </strong><span>designs. A static allocation would be dividing time into discrete intervals and give each connection a chance to communicate using a round-robin algorithm. Dynamic allocations for a common channel are either centralized or decentralized. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span>An example of a centralized dynamic allocation are cellular networks, where a base station determines which phone can communicate next. Decentralized dynamic allocation just means each device can determine by itself when it should transmit. More on this later.</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Metropolitan area networks</strong></p><p><span>Connecting computers in cities, but not really used anymore. Examples are city cable tv networks</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Wide area networks</strong></p><p><span>Each computer is called a </span><strong>host, </strong><span>the rest of the network connecting to these hosts are called a (communication) subnet</span></p><p><br></p><p><span>A wide area network consists of transmission lines (copper, fiberoptic) and switching elements which are also commonly called routers. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span>This makes a WAN very similar to large LANs. The differences are:</span></p><ul><li><span>the hosts and subnet are owned by different people</span></li><li><span>WAN routers will often connect different kinds of networks (ethernet, SONET, etc.)</span></li><li><span>often an Internet Service Provider (ISP) builds and maintains these networks, and customers connect to the ISPs network</span></li></ul><p><br></p><h3 id="network-scales"><span>Network scales</span></h3><ul><li><strong style="background-color: transparent;">Subnet</strong><span style="background-color: transparent;">: A collection of routers and communication lines owned by a network operator. Does not include hosts themselves.</span></li><li><strong style="background-color: transparent;">Network</strong><span style="background-color: transparent;">: subnet + hosts</span></li><li><strong style="background-color: transparent;">Internetwork</strong><span style="background-color: transparent;">: When distinct networks are interconnected. </span></li><li><strong style="background-color: transparent;">Gateway</strong><span style="background-color: transparent;">: connects two different networks, to create an internetwork</span></li></ul><p><br></p><h1 id="network-software"><span>Network software</span></h1><h2 id="network-hierarchy"><span>Network hierarchy</span></h2><p><span>Each layer in the network stack acts like it's talking to the same layer on another machine. In reality only the lowest, physical layer actually is. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span>Each layer adds some extra information (i.e. headers) to the sent data so it can be decoded again on the other end. In each layer errors can occur, so the lower you get, the more error correcting mechanisms should be present. This is difficult as error correcting codes also add overhead so sometimes it's most useful to just be able to detect errors and resend data.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span>Layers can offer two different types of service:</span></p><ul><li><span>when a layer is </span><strong>connection-oriented</strong><span> one can compare it to a telephone, where the sender dials up the receiver and when there is a connection it sends data. While connecting, connection parameters can be negotiated. </span></li><li><span>a </span><strong>connectionless </strong><span>layer is modeled after a postal system. Each message carries the full destination address and is routed through the network independent of all other messages.</span></li><li><strong>unacknowledged</strong><strong> </strong>(unreliable) <strong>connectionless </strong><span>services are often called </span><strong>datagram </strong><span>services.</span></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Store and forward switching</strong><span>: each intermediate node waits until it received a full message before sending it to the next node</span></p><p><strong>Cut through switching</strong><span>: the retransmission of a message is started before it is fully received</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Message sequence</strong><span>: each message has a clear boundary and when two messages are sent they arrive as two distinct messages.</span></p><p><strong>Byte streams</strong><span>: there are no clear boundaries. When a message is received there is no way to tell if they were sent as two separate messages, or as one large message.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span>Some applications like file transfer rely on stable connections where messages are always received correctly in the right order without errors. Other applications like VoIP do not require this and actually benefit from not having it as the overhead would be unacceptable.</span></p><p><br></p><h2 id="services"><strong>Services</strong></h2><p><span>A </span><strong>service </strong><span>is formally specified by a set of primitives (operations) available to user process to access the service. The difference between a </span><strong>service </strong><span>and a </span><strong>protocol </strong><span>is that a service is a set of primitives that a layer provides to a layer above it. A protocol is a set of rules governing the format and meaning of messages.</span></p><p><br></p><h1 id="network-layers"><span>Network layers</span></h1><h2 id="osi"><span>OSI</span></h2><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_network_protocols_(OSI_model)" target="_blank"><strong>The OSI reference model</strong></a></p><p><span>In OSI there are 7 layers according to the following rules:</span></p><ul><li><span>a layer should be created when a different abstraction is needed</span></li><li><span>each layer should perform a well defined function</span></li><li><span>the function of each layer should be chosen with an eye toward defining internationally standardized protocols</span></li><li><span>the layer boundaries should be chosen to minimize the information flow across the interfaces</span></li><li><span>the number of layers should be large enough that distinct functions need not be thrown together in the same layer out of necessity and small enough that the architecture does not become unwieldy</span></li></ul><p><br></p><p><span> The OSI reference model's layers are  </span></p><ul><li><strong>Layer 1</strong><span>: Physical -&gt; transmit raw bits  (e.g.  DSL/ISDN), copper cables</span></li><li><strong>Layer 2</strong><span>: </span><a href="https://cshub.nl/post/970186416" target="_blank">Data link</a><span> -&gt; breaks data up in frames to be transmitted. Detects many transmission errors (e.g. Ethernet/WLAN). A sublayer of this is the </span><a href="https://cshub.nl/post/102873064" target="_blank">Medium Access Control Layer</a></li><li><strong>Layer 3</strong><span>: </span><a href="https://cshub.nl/post/269124847" target="_blank">Network</a><span> -&gt; controls operation of the subnet. Determines routing of packets (e.g. IP/ICMP), how do we get a packet from A to B?</span></li><li><strong>Layer 4</strong><span>: Transport  -&gt; Splits up large amounts of data in to smaller units. This is the first layer that is truly end to end. The layers below are between machines and can have many intermediate machines like routers (e.g. TCP/UDP). You might have to interact with the transport layer when writing an application (for video streams you might interact with the transport layer to make sure it doesn't resend frames that didn't arrive)</span></li><li><strong>Layer 5</strong><span>: Session -&gt; Allows users on different machines to control dialog, do token management and synchronizing data. This includes checkpointing long transmissions so in the event of a system crash the transmission can continue</span></li><li><strong>Layer 6</strong><span>: Presentation -&gt; Concerned with syntax and semantics of the transmitted data. Allows high level data structures to be serialized and transmitted.</span></li><li><strong>Layer 7</strong><span>: Application -&gt; High level protocols (e.g. browsers, FTP, HTTP, Telnet)</span></li></ul><p><br></p><h3 id="critiques-of-osi"><strong>Critiques of OSI</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Bad timing</strong><span>: when OSI came around, companies did not want to support both OSI and TCP/IP. This meant that every company was waiting for every other company to support OSI first.</span></li><li><strong>Bad technology</strong><span>: some layers in OSI are almost empty (session, presentation) and this makes it pretty inefficient.</span></li><li><strong>Bad implementations</strong><span>: this got OSI to be associated with poor quality.</span></li></ul><p><br></p><h2 id="tcp/ip"><span>TCP/IP</span></h2><p><span>The TCP/IP model skips a few layers of the OSI model. It uses the following layers</span></p><ul><li><strong>Layer 1: </strong><span>Network interface -&gt; the OSI data link and physical layers</span></li><li><strong>Layer 2: </strong><span>Internet -&gt; the OSI network layer</span></li><li><strong>Layer 3: </strong><span>Transport -&gt; the OSI transport layer</span></li><li><strong>Layer 4: </strong><span>Application -&gt; the OSI session, presentation and application layers</span></li></ul><p><br></p><h3 id="critiques-of-tcp/ip"><strong>Critiques of TCP/IP</strong></h3><p><span>Mostly that it does not clearly distinguish the concepts of services, interfaces and protocols.</span></p><p><br></p><h1 id="network-standardization"><span>Network standardization</span></h1><p><strong>De facto</strong><span>: standards established by their wide usage like HTTP, WWW etc.</span></p><p><strong>De Jure </strong><span>(by law): made by treaties between countries and some organisations like ITU, ISO, IETF, IEEE</span></p><p><br></p><p><span>Some de facto standards evolve to be de jure. This is the case with HTTP which was quickly picked up by IETF.</span></p><p><br></p><h1 id="example-networks"><span>Example networks</span></h1><p><strong>The internet</strong></p><p><span>Not really a network at all, but a huge collection of different networks.</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The ARPANET</strong></p><p><span>One of the first internets by the US Department of Defense</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong>NSFNET</strong></p><p><span>Mostly a follow-up of ARPANET</span></p><p><br></p><h2 id="architecture-of-the-internet"><span>Architecture of the internet</span></h2><p><span>A common way to connect to an ISP is to use the phone line to a house. </span></p><ul><li><strong>DSL </strong><span>(digital subscriber line) is a system that reuses the phone line for data transmission. You need a (DSL) modem to interpret the signals. At first dial up modems were used but these are rare nowadays.</span></li><li><span>More and more you see </span><strong>FTTH </strong><span>(fibre to the home) which is a specialized fiberglass network for internet access.</span></li></ul><p><br></p><p><span>Either way, you connect to your ISP's </span><strong>IXPs </strong><span>(internet exchange point). One of the largest is the Amsterdam Internet Exchange.</span></p><p><br></p><h2 id="mobile-phone-networks"><span>Mobile phone networks</span></h2><ul><li><strong>AMPS </strong><span>(Advanced mobile phone system) is the first generation of large scale wireless communication networks for mobile phones</span></li><li><strong>GSM </strong><span>(Global system for mobile communications) is the second generation of this which is still the most widely used. It has been upgraded to 2G, 3G and 4G.</span></li><li><strong>Wireless LAN and IEEE 802.11: </strong><span>also called WIFI. Uses access points to emit radio waves around a specific frequency to allow devices to communicate to the internet. Ad hoc networks are networks directly between two computers without an access point. (i.e. Wifi hotspots)</span></li><li><strong>RFID:</strong></li><li class="ql-indent-1"><span>Passive: no power source is present.
