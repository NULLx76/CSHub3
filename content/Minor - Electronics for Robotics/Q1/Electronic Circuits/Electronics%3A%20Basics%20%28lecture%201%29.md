<p>Systems may often be described simply by:</p><ul><li>Their inputs</li><li>How they process the information</li><li>Their outputs</li></ul><p><br></p><p>So they:</p><ul><li><strong>Sense</strong> a quantity (e.g. frequency) from a <strong>source </strong>(e.g. microphone)</li><li><strong>Process </strong>the information</li><li><strong>Produce </strong>a signal at a <strong>load</strong></li></ul><p><br></p><h3 id="imperfections">Imperfections</h3><p>We make a distinction between three types of imperfections:</p><ul><li><strong>Distortion</strong>: systematic &amp; repeatable (clipping, crossover distortion)</li><li><strong>Noise:</strong> random &amp; non-repeatable, exists because you add power to a signal (can be partly removed)</li><li><strong>Bandwidth:</strong> systematic &amp; repeatable, fast transients and high frequencies are lost</li></ul><h3 id=""><br></h3><h3 id="sensors">Sensors</h3><p>A <strong>sensor</strong> converts a physical quantity into an electrical signal. There are many metrics to describe the performance of a sensor, for example <strong>precision</strong> (how much the results are scattered) and <strong>accuracy</strong> (how close the results are to the real, physical, values).</p><p><br></p><p>There are different types of sensors:</p><ul><li><strong>Passive sensor: </strong>power available at output that comes from the observed object</li><li><strong>Diodes: </strong>used for sensing temperature, inexpensive and still very accurate</li><li><strong>Active sensor: </strong>has an <strong>impedance </strong>that is <strong>modulated</strong> by a property of the observed object. It must be <strong>biased </strong>with a bias source</li></ul><p><br></p>
